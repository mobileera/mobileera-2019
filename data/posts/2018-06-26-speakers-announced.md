We received more than 200 of amazing technical talks submissions (a new record!), enough to hold some Mobile Eras in a row. But we pick only the best for you! Like the last years, we had three separate committees (iOS, Android, Web/Cross-platform), with the professionals from corresponding areas. 

Now, we are proud to announce the first speakers selected to educate and entertain you at Mobile Era 2018. We received over six times as many submissions to our call-for-papers as we had slots in the program, so our program committees had a hard job of choosing the best submissions to create a program that will ensure that all our participants gets the best content, no matter what mobile technologies they are interested in.

Here are some of the speakers we are excited to invite to Mobile Era 2018:
