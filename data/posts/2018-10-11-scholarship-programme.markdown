Mobile Era is a conference organized by and for the community, and it’s important to us that all members of the community should be included, also those who would normally be unable to attend for financial reasons. We are very happy to be able to offer The Scholarship Programme (inspired by the one from Web Rebels Conference) to offer financial aid to people from underrepresented groups wanting to attend the conference.

Eligibility
===========

Scholarships are primarily intended to assist people from groups traditionally underrepresented in the local developer community, such as people of non-Scandinavian descent and people with disabilities. However, we wouldn’t presume to be able to provide a complete list of underrepresented groups, so all applications will be considered. Eligibility ultimately depends on the discretion of the selection committee.

Please note that we have student tickets available for a very affordable price.

Selection
=========

All applications will be reviewed by the selection committee, and will be accepted at their discretion, although selection will primarily favor diversity concerns and financial need. All information provided to the committee will be kept strictly confidential.

Award
=====

Selected applicants will receive a fully paid ticket for the conference.

We unfortunately cannot cover travel costs for applicants.

How do I apply?
===============

Just fill in the form. Submission is open until October 19th.
